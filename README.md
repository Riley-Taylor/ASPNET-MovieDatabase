#### Code Features ####
<details> 
<summary>ASP.Net</summary>

🔻 .Net framework was defaulted in. Only subtle changes to the foundation. <br>
🔻 Uses "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" <br>
🔻 Uses "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" <br>
🔻 Uses "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational" <br>
🔻 Uses "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools" <br>

</details>
<details> 
<summary>HTML&CSS</summary>

🔻 I relied on the foundation of C# Core Web App from Microsoft to build the Index, Create, Edit, Delete pages. <br>
🔻 Style changes and content within the pages were coded within style tages at the top of each CSHTML page. <br>
🏁 The only reason the above was done, was the application would not take any changes from the seperate style sheets. <br>


</details>
<details> 
<summary>C#</summary>

🔻 All of the C# that was generated by default was truly a blessing. <br>
🔻 Many changes were made to the C# so the code would pull data from different locations. <br>
🔻 Created custom Viewbags so data could be created, saved, and viewed for the second model. <br>
🔻 Created functions that would order the databases by the order in which the entries were entered. <br>

#### Application Features ####
* The program has 2 models with seperate keys. <br>
* Each model features required fields so the database does not get messed up. <br>
* Each model prevents certain types of data being entered. <br>
* Each model entry can be deleted or edited. <br>
* There is a search bar to search the movies in the database. <br>

### Future Plans ###
🌟 There are no plans to update this project! <br> 
🌟 It would have been cool to get the login page to work, but Visual Studios kept causing issues.
